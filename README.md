#### Questions/Concerns

1. Dont know the correct animations to use for the card on Medical service section
    - The ones you used look good, but we can discuss this.
2. Wasnt confident adding the arrows in
    - We can discuss this.
3. Using Br not sure what else to do to get the text like that other than using line breaks.
    - Using a linebreak to drop some text IN A TITLE is fine, just not in paragraphs.
4. I wanted to hide two of the cards for responsive but all cards have the same class
    - You can achieve this with ids or an additional class on the HTML elements. For instance -> class="some-class-name hidden-class" where hidden-class will have the styling to hide it.
5. I Tried responsive on the Health Section
    - Not bad. I fixed some things up. You're making the wrong things 100%. You need to make the sections that were 50% in flex row, 100% in flex col.
6. The Emergency section right image is not the same as the left.
    - What do you mean by this? Message me on Discord about this.
7. I tried responive for Emergency Section and Its not Working
    - You had a static width on the image, and you didn't make left and right 100%.
8. Does it matter it matter that the width of the emergency-card box is not the exact same width as theirs. I Tried adding a max width on the P tags but couldnt get the exact same.
    - It doesn't have to be the exact same size, but same proportions and also same fractional size of the total width. I can explain this more tonight.
  

# Team section card is too big compared to theirs.
## the images in team section is awful, they didnt have their imgs in src.
## The hover effects are awful and bugged.
##Layout Perfeced.
# tried responsive.


# Review Section Layout  **PERFECTED.**
## The first issue is not using line breaks. every since my dropping of br its messing up my alignment and it did with this card. I dont think its a big issue so im going to skip for now but annoying.
## They also have some weird alignment going in on the last column if you look I dont know the best way to do that to make the two cards above the others.
## ***~~ tried responsive~~***
