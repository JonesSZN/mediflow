#### Questions/Concerns

1. Dont know the correct animations to use for the card on Medical service section
   - The ones you used look good, but we can discuss this.
2. Wasnt confident adding the arrows in
   - We can discuss this.
3. Using Br not sure what else to do to get the text like that other than using line breaks.
   - Using a linebreak to drop some text IN A TITLE is fine, just not in paragraphs.
4. I wanted to hide two of the cards for responsive but all cards have the same class
   - You can achieve this with ids or an additional class on the HTML elements. For instance -> class="some-class-name hidden-class" where hidden-class will have the styling to hide it.
  

# I Tried responsive on the Health Section
## The Emergency section right image is not the same as the left.
### I tried responive for Emergency Section and Its not Working
### Does it matter it matter that the width of the emergency-card box is not the exact same width as theirs. I Tried adding a max width on the P tags but couldnt get the exact same.
