#### Questions/Concerns
# Team section card is too big compared to theirs.
## the images in team section is awful, they didnt have their imgs in src.
## The hover effects are awful and bugged.
##Layout Perfeced.
# tried responsive.

  
# Review Section Layout  **PERFECTED.**
## The first issue is not using line breaks. every since my dropping of br its messing up my alignment and it did with this card. I dont think its a big issue so im going to skip for now but annoying.
## They also have some weird alignment going in on the last column if you look I dont know the best way to do that to make the two cards above the others.
## ***~~ tried responsive~~***
